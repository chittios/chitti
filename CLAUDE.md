*"This project is specified in `CHITTI_OS_HANDOFF.md`. Read it fully before acting. Follow the locked decisions in Part 2 and the guardrails in Part 4. Work one phase at a time; do not start the next phase until the current phase's acceptance criteria pass in QEMU."*

**Current phase: 2 (Execution substrate) — complete.**
Stackful kernel-mode tasks with a hand-written `switch_to` context switch (naked
function, callee-saved regs + RFLAGS saved on each task's own stack); a
round-robin scheduler entered either voluntarily (`sched::yield_now`) or by the
PIT timer once a task's slice of ticks elapses (`sched::on_timer_tick`), so the
same primitive serves both cooperative and timer-preemptive scheduling; a
minimal cooperative async executor (`sched::executor`) for yield-heavy work atop
a single stack; an unforgeable capability system (`cap`) — opaque per-task-table
indices, no ambient authority, no API that names another task's table directly;
and capability-gated IPC (`ipc`) modeled as seL4-style endpoints. `cargo xtask
test` runs 12 in-kernel tests (up from Phase 1's 7): 3 cooperatively-yielding
tasks interleave and all reach their target (checked via a transition count, not
just final counts); a non-yielding task is still forcibly preempted by the timer;
an IPC round-trip delivers a correct reply; a task holding no capability is
denied and the denial is `ktrace`'d; plus an async-executor interleaving test.
Next: Phase 3 (Cortex — CPU inference runtime, highest risk).
